# Lab 2 - Explore rest APIs with API-simulator and postman
## 2.1 Explore API Documentation Using the API Simulator
### •  Task preparation and implementation:
#### API call using GUI
We visit library.demo.local, it puts us in the Our Books tab. Then we click `Click here for API docs` and click /api/v1 > GET /books
Now we can make our first API call using the GET /books API (GUI) > Try it out > Execute:
#### API call using curl
We make our first API call with curl using `curl -X get "http://library.demo.local/api/v1/books?includeISBN=true" -H accept: application/json` this returns the books with ISBN true

Visible in our books now 
Also Get books shows these
#### Delete book using curl and API key
curl -X DELETE "http://library.demo.local/api/v1/books/4" -H "accept: application/json" -H "X-API-KEY: cisco|7F8RljSITKTpnaa_YJp8fCcgkUrmauZ4wlx6vopD1yk"

#### Post book response
We post a book reponse, we get code 200 success and it is now visible in Our books

### Task troubleshooting: curl api call wasn’t working -> worked after restart & sudo apt update

### Task verification:  
#### API calls: <br>
#### GUI:

## 2.2 Use Postman to make API calls to the API simulator
###	Task preparation and implementation: 
We make POST request with the api key

![Post Request](https://github.com/BrechtKeppens/Devasc_Skills/blob/main/Lab%202%20-%20Explore%20rest%20APIs%20with%20API-simulator%20and%20postman/PostRequest.png)


###	Task troubleshooting: 
Method not allowed but was using get instead of post when trying to retrieve API Key

###	Task verification: 
Confirmation of POST request, id 4 is back in there now. We removed it in the last excercise :

![Post Verification](https://github.com/BrechtKeppens/Devasc_Skills/blob/main/Lab%202%20-%20Explore%20rest%20APIs%20with%20API-simulator%20and%20postman/PostVerification.png)

## 2.3 Use python to add 100 books to the API simulator


# Lab 3 - Python Review - Development tools and Classes
## 3.1 Python Programming Review

### • Task preparation and implementation:
Important commands:

#### Type(): Returns the variable type 
`string=”e” `
`type(string) => class’str’`

#### f{}: Input variable value in string
`f”The string contains {string}”` returns "The string contains e"

#### .2f : Decimals
`pi = “{:.2f}”.format(num) ` returns 3.14

#### List: [] List of items
`testlist = [“one”,”two”,”three”]`
`del testlist[x]` Removes list item at position x

#### Dictionary: {} Dictionary of items
`Routers: {“R1”:”10.1.1.1”,”R2”:10.2.2.1”}`

#### Len(): Number of items in list
`len(testlist)` returns 3

#### Input: Reads user input:
`input(“enter a value”)` asks for input with the prompt enter a value:

#### Print(“"): prints value to the console
`print(“test”)` prints test

#### if else/elif function example with input & print:
```
age = string(input(’Enter your age:”))
if age >=18:
	print(“You are 18 years of age or older”)
elif age >=16:
		print(“You are 16 years of age or older”)
	else:
		print(“You are under 16 years of age”)
```
You will be prompted to enter your age. It will display whether you are over 18, between 16-18 or under 16 years of age.

#### For loop example: print all items in a list
```
namelist[“Brecht”,”Rick”,”Gert”]

for name in namelist:
print(name)
``` 
Prints every name in namelist

#### While loop example
```
a = 10
b = 0
While a>b:
	print(b)
	b=b+1
```
counts to 10
	
#### Open(“") opens a file
`x = open(“test.txt”) opens a file named text.txt and stores it in x`
### • Task Troubleshooting
None needed
### • Task Verification
Code explained above
## 3.2 Explore Python Development Tools

### • Task preparation and implementation:
Documented findings and important commands:
#### Define & call a function:
```
Def Newfunction:
	Print(“Function called”)
Newfunction()
```
Here we define a function "Newfunction" and call it using Newfunction()
#### Define & call method in a class:
```
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        
Brecht = Person("Brecht", "25")
print(Brecht.name)
print(Brecht.age)
```
Here we define a Person class with a constructor (__init__) that takes name and age parameters. An instance of the class is created with the name "Brecht" and age "25", and the name and age attributes are accessed and displayed.

# Lab 4 - Network Infrastructure and troubleshooting
## • Task Preparation and implementation:
#### Install, configure and test the network infrastructure based on the network drawing	
![Network Plan](https://github.com/BrechtKeppens/Devasc_Skills/blob/main/Lab%204%20-%20Network%20infrastructure%20and%20troubleshooting/Networkplan.png)

#### Proactively determine what is needed to ensure the continuity of the system and network infrastructure
HSRP has been configured on the routers to ensure redundancy. This also supplies the netwerk with scalability for the routers.

We configure a domain name using the following command:
`ip domain name pxl.be`

### Apply best practices to configuration and network security
- Vlans have been configured for best practice segmentation
- For security reasons we chose to use SSH 2.0 using the following commands:
```
crypto key generate rsa 1024
ip ssh version 2
```
Then we made an ssh user:
```
username cisco password class.
```
- All unused ports are in down state and we put them in an unused vlan.
- Sticky mac adress on user ports
- 1:30min timeout exec
### Draw up an IP plan and document your solution
| DEVICE          | INTERFACE   | IP            | VLAN |
|-----------------|-------------|---------------|------|
| LAB-RA09-C-R03  | G0/0.10     | 172.16.9.4    | 10   |
|                 | G0/0.10HSRP | 172.16.9.1    | 10   |
|                 | G0/0.40     | 172.16.9.52   | 40   |
|                 | G0/0.40HSRP | 172.16.9.49   | 40   |

| LAB-RA09-A-SW03 | VLAN10      | 172.16.9.7    | 10   |
### Make sure you can backup and restore device configuration from a backup environment
Router:
```
en
conf t

Switch:
```
en

switchport trunk native vlan 99
no shutdown

lab-ra09-c-r03-confg
```


### • Task Troubleshooting:
---
#### - Problem 1: Unable to connect to teachers' switch.
##### Cause: Switch ports were down by default.
##### Solution: Enter no shutdown on the port in question.
---
#### - Problem 2: Unable to ping or tftp from router to remote pc
##### Cause: Routing issue caused the 10.199.66.X network to not route 
##### Solution:  Ping using router's subinterface (using vlan ip address)
##### the `ip tftp source-interface gigabitEthernet 0/0.10` command sets our vlan ip adress as the source for tftp.
---
#### - Problem 3: No connectivity, something changed in configs
##### Cause: Someone unplugged our cable and plugged it into a different port
##### Solution: Followed cables to find out who used our port, and replaced it.
---
#### - Problem 4: Router auto configured ACLs after erase & reload
##### Cause: Bug caused by exec-timeout
##### Solution: Disable exec timeout

# Lab 7 YANG, NETCONFIG and RESTCONFIG

## 7.1 Install CSR1000v VM
### ● Task preparation and implementation
.IOVA && .iso file downloaded from the teachers onedrive
Install Vmware if needed, virtualbox will not work for this lab
1.	Import the .iova file to vmware
2.	Go to VM settings and click the first CD/DVD in the list, replace the current iso file with the one downloaded from your course instructor	
3.	Launch VM
4.	Ping Devasc machine to ensure connectivity
5.	Visit the CSR1000v webinterface (https://ip)
### ● Task troubleshooting
1. We needed an ISO file which the teacher did not have access to but he ended up finding a downloadable version online. 
2. I checked Live CD/DVD which made me encounter some issues, these were resolved when I unchecked the option
3. I did not get an ip address assigned to my adapter in virtualbox, I switched to vmware and this solved the issue
